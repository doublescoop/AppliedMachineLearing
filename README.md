# Applied Machine Learing CS5785
Machine Learning practices from Cornell CS5785 

### ML and statistic techniques used in these projects include... 
**NLP** :
- Binary Classification and prediction using Bag of Words / Ngrams
- implementing Bag of Words, vectorize vocabulaires from scratch 
- Implement Logistics Regression, Linear SVM, non-linear SVM 
- dataset: 


**CNN** : 
- Implement 2D convolutional Neural Network, using keras library 
- Experiment with the number of convolutional layers, Pooling, Dropout,and learning rate.
- dataset:

**Random Forest**: 



## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install keras
```

for the minst digits dataset used in the code: 
```
from keras.datasets import mnist
```

## Training


>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below)


## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
