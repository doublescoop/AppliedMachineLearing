# Applied Machine Learing CS5785
Machine Learning practices from Cornell CS5785 

### ML and statistic techniques used in these projects include... 
**NLP** :
- Binary Classification and Prediction using Bag of Words / Ngrams
- Implement Bag of Words, vectorize vocabulaires from scratch 
- Implement Logistics Regression, Linear SVM, non-linear SVM 
- dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started


**CNN/GNN** : 
- Implement 2D convolutional Neural Network, using keras library 
- Experiment with the number of convolutional layers, Pooling, Dropout,and learning rate.
- Implement GNN to regenerate Mona Lisa pic
- dataset: Mona Lisa pic / Old Faithful geyser data https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/all-of-statistics/=data/faithful.dat


**Recommendation System / Collaborative Filtering**:
- Content-based recommendation on written description of wine reviews (bigram Bag of Words from highly scored wines, clustered with Gaussian mixture model) 
- User-User collaborative filtering based on the review history (highly scored wine orgins)
- dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews
